		npc.sayNext("But Water of Life only comes out little at the very bottom of the World Tree, so I can't give him too much time in life... I know, it's very unfortunate... but even if it becomes a doll again I can always bring life back into it so be good to it while you're with it.");

		npc.sayNext("Depending on the command you give, pets can love it, hate, and display other kinds of reactions to it. If you give the pet a command and it follows you well, your intimacy goes up. Double click on the pet and you can check the intimacy, level, fullness and etc...");

As the intimacy level rises, the pet's overall level will rise soon after. As the overall level rises, one day the pet may even talk like a person a little bit, so try hard raising it. Of course it won't be easy doing so...");

After a while, it won't even follow your command and be on the offensive, so watch out over that.");
